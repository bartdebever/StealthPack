## Unity

Ensure you are using a project version above `2018.4.11f1`, this is an LTS version
and the pack was developed in that version. However, this pack was also tested on
version `2019.2.10f1` and found to be working correctly.

If you do find a version that does not work, please feel free to submit it to
the tabel bellow.

| Version | Breaking Change | Incompatibility (in %) |
|---------|-----------------|------------------------|
|         |                 |                        |

## Inserting the pack into your project

For the actual installation of the project, just grab the `scripts.zip` file from
the [releases](https://github.com/bartdebever/stealthpack/releases) and extract it
into your own scripts folder. You are free to edit a script if it better fits your needs.
Please feel free to submit any bugs as an issue and the fixes for those bugs or improvements
to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bartdebever/stealthpack).
